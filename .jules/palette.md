**Learning:** In multi-frame CustomTkinter applications, providing visual feedback for the active navigation state is crucial for user orientation. Storing button references in a dictionary keyed by frame name allows for efficient programmatic state management. Using class constants for design tokens (like inactive colors) prevents style duplication and makes the UI easier to maintain.
**Action:** Always implement active state tracking in sidebar navigation by storing button references and using a centralized styling method or constants.
