## 2025-02-21 - Active Navigation Highlighting in CustomTkinter
**Learning:** In desktop applications using CustomTkinter, providing visual feedback for the active navigation state is crucial for user orientation. Using `fg_color=None` is an effective way to revert a button to its default theme color from a `"transparent"` state.
**Action:** Always ensure navigation components have a clearly visible active state. Store button references in a dictionary during initialization to allow easy state management during frame transitions.
