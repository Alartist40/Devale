## 2025-05-14 - Sidebar Navigation Highlighting in CustomTkinter
**Learning:** In multi-frame desktop applications with sidebar navigation, providing visual feedback for the active state is crucial for user orientation. Storing button references in a dictionary keyed by frame name allows for efficient programmatic state management. Using class constants for design tokens (like inactive colors) prevents style duplication and ensures consistent contrast when highlighting.
**Action:** Always implement active state tracking in sidebar navigation by storing button references in a registry and using centralized design tokens or constants for styling.
